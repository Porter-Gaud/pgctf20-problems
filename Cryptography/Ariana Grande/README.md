# Ariana Grande - 50 Points
## Problem
You entered a competition to get VIP Ariana Grande tickets but in order to win you have to solve the challenge.

You were given this file and found a this message:

U+1F4B2 U+2139 U+1F976 U+1F511

## Solution
The unicode above translates to emoji which visually spell out "cybersecurity". When the text file is run through and XOR decrypter with the passphrase "cybersecurity" it is decoded to the entire emoji movie script with the flag hidden inside.

## Flag
`pgctf{too_much_emoji}`
