## Problem
PGCTF has a pretty obscure account somwhere on the internet. Can you find it?

## Hint
“You know my methods, Watson”

## Solution
The goal of this problem is to find an obscure PGCTF account. Using the tool Sherlock is one of the fastest ways to find the account. When Sherlock is used with the user name "pgctf" it returns a list of sites, one of which is blip.fm. The flag is found in the users "blips."
