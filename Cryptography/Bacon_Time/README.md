# Bacon Time - 15 Points
## Problem
I like bacon but sometimes the bacon talks back.

`ABBBBAABBAAAABABAABBAABAB{BAABBAABBBABAAABAABA_AAAABAAAAAAAABAABBBAABBAB_AABBBAAAAABAABA_BAABAAAAAABAABABAABA}` 

Maybe you can figure out what the bacon is trying to convey.

## Solution
Using the 'Bacon Cipher', the message can be decoded to say:

`PGCTF{THIS_BACON_HAS_SASS}`

## Flag
`pgctf{this_bacon_has_sass}`
