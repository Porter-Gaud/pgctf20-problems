## Problem
I really had fun designing this year's PGCTF theme. Maybe a little bit too much fun.

[Here you go.](forensics_problem_2.png)

## Solution
It's pretty simpleâ€”just zoom into the bottom of the image near the middle. In the grid, there's some very small text with the flag.

## Flag
`pgctf{h4cker_br0}`

OR

`pgctf{h4cker_bro}` is also accepted.
