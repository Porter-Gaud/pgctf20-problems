# Swifty Buildy - 40 Points
## Problem
I found [a wild binary](assets/swifty_buildy) in the White House. What do you think it does?

*This is a reverse engineering problem.*

## Solution
*This problem was tested on both Windows and macOS.* \
**macOS** Run the `strings` command on the binary. \
**Windows** I used an online decompiler. There may be an easier way.

## Flag
`pgctf{lets_revers3_it}`
