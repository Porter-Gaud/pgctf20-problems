Title: The Carder (you can change this if you want)

Description: (you can change this also)
I just bought a new credit card dump off the dark web but some of the numbers aren't working.
Can you help me find which one is valid?

nc #ip #port

file: carddump.txt

(You can exclude this if you want the description should be enough)
Hint: How do you check if a card number is valid?
