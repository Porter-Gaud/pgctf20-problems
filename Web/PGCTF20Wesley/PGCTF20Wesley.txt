# Wesley's CTF - ?? Points
## Problem
We found this written in the back of a copy of Beowulf in an abandoned classroom...

The agile grey mouse
fights in the barren jungle.
The pine needles show.


## Solution
This is a hipku. Decode and go to the ip and you will be greeted with the message:

'flag: '

Inspect and the flag is commented

## Flag
