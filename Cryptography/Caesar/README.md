# Caesar - 10 Points
## Problem
I went to Caesar's Palace in Las Vegasâ€”I'm a little bit concerned though because I found this written on a little sheet in my room: 

`Iqxoayq fa Omqemde Bmxmoq! Smynxq kagd yazqk fa ge. bsofr{yaz3k_r0d_zaftuz}` 

Can you make something out of it? All I see is jibberish.

## Solution
Running this through a simple ROT-12 will solve the solution and reveal the secret message:

`Welcome to Caesars Palace! Gamble your money to us. pgctf{mon3y_f0r_nothin}`

## Flag
`pgctf{mon3y_f0r_nothin}`
