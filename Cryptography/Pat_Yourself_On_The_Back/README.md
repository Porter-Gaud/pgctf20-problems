# Pat Yourself On The Back - 10 Points
## Problem
Even if you look around everywhere you can see, the flag is still nowhere to be seen.

Once you find, make sure to pat yourself on the back.

## Solution
The flag is located on the back of the PGCTF20 attendee shirts as:
`ctpgs{flagujnir}`

Decode with ROT13 and you get:

`pgctf{synthwave}`

## Flag
`pgctf{synthwave}`
