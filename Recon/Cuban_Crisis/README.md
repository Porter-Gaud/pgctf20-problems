# An Unlikely Cuban Crisis - 50 Points
## Problem
There was an interestingly disingenuous document published by the CIA. One line in this document stated, "I am going to come back and run against you and lick you"

Please give the code that comes directly after the date written (EX: AB09ZQQ). No need to use flag format.

## Solution
Using Google site:.gov, search for the quote.
